Ignite X is an innovative IoT-based project designed to safely ignite firecrackers remotely using a mobile application. Built around an Arduino Uno, a 5V relay module, an HC-05 Bluetooth module, jumper wires, NiChrome wire, and powered by a 20V battery setup, this project focuses on enhancing both fun and safety. Users can control the igniter through a simple Android app developed in Android Studio, which provides manual button controls for bursting crackers. Additionally, Ignite X supports PS4 remote controllers or consoles via Bluetooth, allowing users to trigger firecrackers using a gamepad interface. One of the standout features is the integration of voice commands; users can say keywords like "launch the rocket" or "blast" to automatically activate the ignition system, adding a smart and hands-free dimension to the experience. The mobile app connects to the Arduino Uno via the HC-05 Bluetooth module, sending commands that activate the relay module, which in turn powers the NiChrome wire to ignite the firecracker. The design ensures wireless communication with a reasonable operating distance and quick response time. Ignite X aims to blend traditional celebrations with modern technology, ensuring a safer and more thrilling experience. Future improvements include expanding control options via Wi-Fi, adding scheduled ignition features, and enhancing the app interface with real-time status feedback. As the project involves handling fire and explosives, all users are strongly advised to follow strict safety precautions and operate the device only in safe, open environments. Ignite X demonstrates how IoT and creativity can bring new life to old traditions.
